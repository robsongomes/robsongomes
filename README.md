### Hi there! 😁

My name is Robson Gomes from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Developer since 2005 and currently I'm Software Architect at [Dataprev](https://portal2.dataprev.gov.br/). I'm passionate about Java Programming and Front-end Development, so if you're interested you can find some cool projects here in my github profile and I'm going to start sharing some articles in my recently created personal blog at (http://robson.dev.br)

In my free time I like to watch soccer (⚽️) and i'm a CearaSC fan, to play Dota, to read books (📚), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), and to listen to music (🎵).

Would you like to find me?
